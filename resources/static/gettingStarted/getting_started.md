# Environment Setup üõ†Ô∏è

To set up your coding environment, follow these steps:

# **Download and Install Python**:
<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Visit the official <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Python website</a> and download the latest version of Python for your system.</li>
   <li>‚û§ Make sure to check the box that says <strong>"Add Python to PATH"</strong> during installation to ensure it's available from the command line.</li>
</ul>

# **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Download <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/Download" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Visual Studio Code</a> from the official website</li>
   <li>‚û§ After installation, <strong>launch VS Code</strong> and install the Python extension from the Extensions Marketplace for better code support.</li>
</ul>

# **Install Git Bash for Windows**:
<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Download <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline;">Git Bash</a> from the Git Website and install it.</li>
   <li>‚û§ Git Bash will allow you to use a Unix-like command line on Windows, which is helpful for running Python scripts and managing your coding environment.</li>
</ul>


# **Verify Python Installation**:
<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Open a Git Bash window terminal in vsCode and type the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:</li>
   <pre><code class="language-bash">python --version</code></pre>
   <li>‚û§ You should see the installed Python version. If you don't, check the installation steps again or ensure Python is added to your system's PATH.</li>
</ul>


# lessons: üìö
<ul>
  <li>‚û§ lessons are only available in terminal by command `lesson`</li>
</ul>

# Assignments: üíº
<ul>
  <li>‚û§ Assignments are only available in terminal by command `assignment`</li>
   <li>‚û§ Assignments consist of three questions:</li>
   <li>‚û¢    A basic check to confirm understanding of the concept</li>
   <li>‚û¢    A practical application in a common scenario.</li>
   <li>‚û¢    A creative challenge to test deeper problem-solving.</li>
   <li>‚û§ Safety measures will be applied to prevent cheating</li>
</ul>
