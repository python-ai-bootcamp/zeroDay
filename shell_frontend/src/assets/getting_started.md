# How to setup local Python environment? üêç
To set up your local Python environment, follow these steps:

# **Download and Install Python**:
<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your system.</li>
   <li>‚û§ Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation to ensure it's available from the command line.</li>
</ul>

# **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:

<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Download Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).</li>
   <li>‚û§ After installation, launch VS Code and install the Python extension from the Extensions Marketplace for better code support.</li>
</ul>

# **Install Git Bash for Windows**:
<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Download Git Bash from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.</li>
   <li>‚û§ Git Bash will allow you to use a Unix-like command line on Windows, which is helpful for running Python scripts and managing your coding environment.</li>
</ul>


# **Verify Python Installation**:
<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Open a command prompt or Git Bash window and type the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:</li>
   ```bash
     python --version
   ```
   <li>‚û§ You should see the installed Python version. If you don't, check the installation steps again or ensure Python is added to your system's PATH.</li>
</ul>


# **Install Required Libraries**:

     ```bash
     pip install <library-name>
     ```

# **Start Coding**:
<ul>
   <li>‚û§ Open VS Code, create a new Python file, and start coding!</li>
</ul>

# How to get lessons? üìö
<ul>
  <li>‚û§ Weekly lessons available via the course portal or email.</li>
  <li>‚û§ Lessons cover a range of Python topics, from basics to advanced concepts in AI and cybersecurity.</li>
  <li>‚û§ Regular updates on new lessons, assignments, and resources in the course portal.</li>
</ul>

# How to take tests? üß™
<ul>
  <li>‚û§ Complete a test or quiz at the end of each week to evaluate your understanding.</li>
  <li>‚û§ Tests track your progress and ensure readiness for the next stage of the course.</li>
  <li>‚û§ Tests are available online and can be taken at your own pace within the week.</li>
  <li>‚û§ Ensure tests are completed before the deadline to continue to the next stage.</li>
</ul>

# What are the requirements to this course? ‚úÖ
<ul>
  <li>‚û§ Access to a computer with an internet connection is required for all course materials, lessons, and tests.</li>
  <li>‚û§ No prior programming experience is needed, but familiarity with basic computer usage is helpful.</li>
  <li>‚û§ Install Python, VS Code, and Git Bash to start coding.</li>
  <li>‚û§ Ensure you have enough time to commit to weekly lessons and tests to make the most of the boot camp.</li>
</ul>
