# What does this course provide? üéÅ
This course provides a comprehensive set of tools and resources to help you learn modern Python programming, including its applications in artificial intelligence (AI) and cybersecurity. You will gain access to interactive lessons, coding exercises, quizzes, and an online community where you can ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate with other learners. By the end of the course, you'll have hands-on experience with Python and a basic understanding of its use in cutting-edge fields like AI and cyber tools.

# What does this course cost? üí∞
The course costs 50 NIS per section. Each section covers specific topics and comes with associated lessons and quizzes. This fee gives you access to the full course content for that week, including tests and assignments that are key to completing the boot camp and earning an invitation to join the research group upon successful completion of the course.

# How does it work? ‚öôÔ∏è
The course runs for 6 weeks. Each week, you'll be provided with new lessons that cover different aspects of Python programming. Along with the lessons, there will be a test at the end of each week to evaluate your understanding of the material. These tests are designed to be challenging, ensuring you get the most out of the boot camp. At the end of the 6 weeks, students who successfully complete the program will be invited to participate in a research group for further development.

# How to setup local Python environment? üêç
To set up your local Python environment, follow these steps:

1. **Download and Install Python**:
   - Visit the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download the latest version of Python for your system.
   - Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during installation to ensure it's available from the command line.

2. **Install Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**:
   - Download Visual Studio Code from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).
   - After installation, launch VS Code and install the Python extension from the Extensions Marketplace for better code support.

3. **Install Git Bash for Windows**:
   - Download Git Bash from the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and install it.
   - Git Bash will allow you to use a Unix-like command line on Windows, which is helpful for running Python scripts and managing your coding environment.

4. **Verify Python Installation**:
   - Open a command prompt or Git Bash window and type the following command to check if Python is installed correctly:
     ```
     python --version
     ```
   - You should see the installed Python version. If you don't, check the installation steps again or ensure Python is added to your system's PATH.

5. **Set up Virtual Environment**:
   - It's a good practice to work within a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other Python projects. In Git Bash, navigate to your project folder and run the following commands:
     ```
     python -m venv myenv
     source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use myenv\Scripts\activate
     ```

6. **Install Required Libraries**:
   - Once the virtual environment is set up, you can install any required Python libraries using pip:
     ```
     pip install <library-name>
     ```

7. **Start Coding**:
   - Open VS Code, create a new Python file, and start coding!

# How to get lessons? üìö
Lessons will be provided on a weekly basis. Every week, new content will be made available through the course portal or via email. You‚Äôll receive a structured set of lessons that cover various Python topics, from the basics to more advanced concepts related to AI and cybersecurity. Make sure to check the course portal regularly for updates on new lessons, assignments, and resources.

# How to take tests? üß™
At the end of each week, you'll be required to complete a test or quiz that evaluates your understanding of the topics covered in the lessons. These tests are essential to track your progress and ensure you‚Äôre ready for the next stage of the course. The tests will be available online, and you can take them at your own pace within the week. Be sure to complete each test before the deadline to continue to the next stage.

# What are the requirements to this course? ‚úÖ
Before starting the course, you should have access to a computer with an internet connection, as all course materials, lessons, and tests will be online. No prior programming experience is required, but it‚Äôs helpful if you‚Äôre familiar with basic computer usage. You'll need to install Python, VS Code, and Git Bash to get started with coding. Ensure you have enough time to commit to the weekly lessons and tests to make the most of this boot camp.
